b. Cardiovascular endurance  
c. Muscular strength

5\. Play @ Ping Yi

Play @ Ping Yi is an extension of the PE programme where students pursue sports of their interest beyond PE. Play is part of school where sport facilities are placed in common spaces for students to engage in regular play to build social bonds and develop a passion for sports. Some of the activities include Table-tennis, Pool, e-sport and Football.

  

6\. Sports for a Cause

Ping Yi participates in sports for a cause to educate students to be advocates of social causes. Some of the activities include The Straits Time Run and The Yellow Ribbon Run. This also serves to encourage students to engage in healthy living beyond school while at the same time, advocating for a social cause. It is also a platform where students and staff participate the same activity, to develop strong student-teacher relationship.
