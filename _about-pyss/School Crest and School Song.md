School Crest and School Song
============================

<img src="/images/logo.png" style="width:20%">

### **The School Crest**

A stylized plant is graphically represented in this crest. Like new life, Ping Yi nurtures and empowers our student with confidence and conviction to reach for their aspirations. The outstretched leaves also represent the core tenets of Ping Yi, impartiality and dignity, the key attributes in our student’s character development.

### **Ping Yi Secondary School Song**

  
<p style="text-align: center;">To humbly strive and never yield</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">At work, at school and play</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Sincere in thoughts, words and deeds</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The true Ping Yian way</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">From each our very best we give</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Success along the way</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We pledge our loyal selves to you</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Both school and country</p>

  

<p style="text-align: center;">Come let us work in harmony</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">To strengthen our fond ties</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Together we will scale the heights</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">United we’ll succeed</p>

  

<p style="text-align: center;">In Ping Yi’s hall our love and toil</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Will answer every call</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">We pledge to you our hearts again</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Ping Yi forevermore</p>
