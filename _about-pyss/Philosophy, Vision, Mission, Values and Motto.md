Philosophy, Vision, Mission, Values and Motto
=============================================

### Origins of School Name

The name ‘Ping Yi’ may be traced to Pin Ghee Public School which was a school in Chai Chee founded in 1930. The ‘kampong’ school had to close to make way for redevelopment in 1976. It was decided to keep the school’s name for a new government primary and a secondary school to be built in the area. The name ‘Ping Yi’ which is the Hanyu Pinyin of ‘Pin Ghee’, thus has a history. The first character of the school name ‘Ping’ means fairness and impartially, while ‘Yi’ means dignified bearing.
