Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB)
================================

#### Details of full SBB Pilot

Ping Yi Secondary School is one of the 28 secondary schools selected by the Ministry of Education to start piloting aspects of Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) from 2020 onwards. 

  

#### Purpose of Full SBB

With Full SBB, we are moving towards one secondary education, with many subject bands, to better meet our students’ learning needs, without labels. This is part of the broader shift in our education system to recognise the strengths and interests of our children, to help them build their confidence and develop an intrinsic motivation to learn for life in them. By 2021, the pilot schools will have fully implemented the following aspects of Full SBB:

*   Organising Secondary 1 form classes in new ways; or
*   Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.
