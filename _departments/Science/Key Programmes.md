### Department Overview

The Science Department is committed to develop a community of curious learners and critical thinkers by inculcating the spirit of scientific inquiry and curiosity. Knowledge is socially constructed. In our Science classrooms, every individual is a contributor and a co-creator of knowledge. Together, we question, initiate inquiry and improve our ideas by rethinking and refining explanations to problems. Students own the learning while teachers design and facilitate learning.

  

  

### Inquisitive Learners

Science lessons are designed to arouse curiosity in curricula based issues and facilitating students in the construction of knowledge based on students’ emerging responses. Opportunities are created so students can collaboratively refine ideas or critically reflect to identify gaps in their own explanations. Students are engaged in hands-on and minds-on science activities which include designing and constructing Hot House, Portable Water filter System and A Drag Car. These experiences pique students’ interest in learning and build in them confidence to seek clarification, analyse data and formulate answers. This is the quintessence of \`learning ignite’ where students’ learning far surpassed their learning experience in conventional teaching environment.

Teachers’ Sharings  

In the 21st century classroom, teachers are facilitators of student learning and creators of productive classroom environments, in which students can acquire knowledge and develop the skills they might need at present or in future. To remain relevant and effective teacher leaders in this changing educational landscape, our teachers are constantly reflecting their practices. We learn and share our practices both within our fraternity and internationally. Platforms where teachers have learned and shared among educators includes:

  

*   International Science Education Conference
*   Knowledge Building
*   Overseas Teacher Attachment Programme
*   Knowledge Building Summit
*   Knowledge Building Network Learning Community
*   MOE ExCEL Fest Teachers’ Conference
*   The International Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning
