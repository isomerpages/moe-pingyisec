### Department Overview

*   Our Mission

To develop and nurture critical global citizens who pursue knowledge and wisdom passionately through the Humanities.

  

*   Introduction

The teaching and learning of the Humanities come alive in Ping Yi! Here, teaching and learning take place beyond the textbooks and confines of the classroom. We believe in giving students authentic and varied opportunities to connect with what they have learnt in theory to what they experience in reality. We complement what the students study in their textbooks with regular strokes of reality.

  

The department organises local and overseas learning journeys and field studies. These opportunities and experiences ignite the interest of students, sustain their curiosity and keep students highly involved in their own learning. Students also deepen their learning of concepts, have a greater appreciation of social and historical contexts and can justify geographical phenomena. At the same time, they also acquire 21st century competencies, skills and values. We extend our students’ learning by participating in competitions and workshops organised by external organizations and national institutions. Students are able to acquire or apply their knowledge and skills and through these experiences, are more ready for the future.

  

  

### Our Learning Journeys

*   Geography

1\. Gardens By the Bay/East Coast Park
